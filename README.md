#NumPy--Cleaned

A lightweight, Decimal-safe math and array library for environments where NumPy is not practical
(schools, restricted systems, macros, low-permission computers).

This is not a NumPy replacement.
It is a safe, understandable alternative for basic numeric work.

Why NumPy--Cleaned?

NumPy is powerful, but:

❌ Often unavailable on school computers

❌ Hard to install on restricted systems

❌ Overkill for simple math and arrays

❌ Uses floating-point math by default

NumPy--revised focuses on:

✅ Pure Python (no C extensions)

✅ Decimal-based precision

✅ Predictable behavior

✅ Game & education friendliness

✅ Clear, readable source code

What’s inside?
📐 Maths (maths_cleaned.py)

Factorials, Fibonacci, roots, powers

Trigonometry (series-based)

Geometry helpers

Finance & statistics

Number theory

Game-friendly math (clamp, smoothstep, logistic)

All calculations are Decimal-safe.

🔢 Arrays (arrays.py)

A small, NumPy-like system:

Array1, Array2, Array3

Element-wise operations

Scalar and array math

Works without NumPy

Designed for clarity, not magic

Example:

from NumPy--revised import Array1

a = Array1([1, 2, 3])
b = Array1([4, 5, 6])

result = a.add(b)
print(result.to_list())  # [5, 7, 9]

🔁 Conditional int/float conversion (condint.py)

Some systems require integers only, but calculations need floats.

condint solves this safely.

from NumPy--revised import condint

condint(3.0)      # → 3
condint(3.7)      # → 3.7
condint(3.0, to_type="float")  # → 3.0


Useful for:

Games

Grid systems

School engines

Macro environments

🛡 Stability layer (stabilize.py)

A friendly decorator for reliability:

@stabilize
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b


Instead of scary errors, you get:

Cannot divide by zero. Please change.

Installation

Currently designed for local use:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NumPy--revised


Then:

from NumPy--revised import Array1, condint


(Pip support may come later.)

Design philosophy

Simple > clever

Readable > fast hacks

Safe > silent failures

Understandable > opaque optimizations

This library is meant to be read, learned from, and trusted.
